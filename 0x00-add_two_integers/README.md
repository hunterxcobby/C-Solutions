## Problem

Given two integers `num1` and `num2`, return the sum of the two integers.

## Solution

### Intuition
The problem requires finding the sum of two integers, which is a straightforward mathematical operation.

### Approach
The approach is to define a function `sum` that takes two integer parameters `num1` and `num2`. Inside the function, we add `num1` and `num2` together and return the result.

### Complexity
- **Time complexity**:
  The time complexity of this function is constant, denoted as O(1), since the addition operation takes a constant amount of time regardless of the input values.

- **Space complexity**:
  The space complexity is also constant, denoted as O(1), as the function only uses a fixed amount of memory to store the input parameters and the result.

## Example Usage

### Example 1:

```
Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
Output: 17
Explanation: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: num1 = -10, num2 = 4
Output: -6
Explanation: num1 + num2 = -6, so -6 is returned.
```

## Constraints

- `num1` and `num2` are integers in the range of -100 to 100.
