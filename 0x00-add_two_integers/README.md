## Problem

Given two integers `num1` and `num2`, return the sum of the two integers.

## Solution

The solution involves adding `num1` and `num2` together to obtain the result.

## Example Usage

### Example 1:

```
Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
Output: 17
Explanation: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: num1 = -10, num2 = 4
Output: -6
Explanation: num1 + num2 = -6, so -6 is returned.
```

## Constraints

- `num1` and `num2` are integers in the range of -100 to 100.
