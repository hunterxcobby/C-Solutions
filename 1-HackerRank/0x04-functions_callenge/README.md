# Function Usage in C

## Objective

In this challenge, we will explore the simple usage of functions in C. Functions are a group of statements grouped together, provided with zero or more arguments. They execute the statements on those arguments and either return nothing (`void`) or something based on the return type.

### Sample Function Syntax

```c
return_type function_name(arg_type_1 arg_1, arg_type_2 arg_2, ...) {
    // ...
    // ...
    // ...
    [if return_type is non-void]
    return something of type `return_type`;
}
```

For instance, a function to read four variables and return their sum can be written as:

```c
int sum_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
    int sum = 0;
    sum += a;
    sum += b;
    sum += c;
    sum += d;
    return sum;
}
```

`+=`: Add and assignment operator. It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. `a += b` is equivalent to `a = a + b`.

## Task

Write a function `int max_of_four(int a, int b, int c, int d)` which reads four arguments and returns the greatest of them.

**Note**: There is no built-in `max` function in C. Code that will be reused is often put in a separate function, e.g. `int max(x, y)` that returns the greater of the two values.

## Input Format

Input will contain four integers, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, one on each line.

## Output Format

Print the greatest of the four integers.

**Note**: I/O will be automatically handled.

## Sample Input

```

## Sample Output
