## Objective

In this challenge, we will learn some basic concepts of C that will get you started with the language. You will need to use the same syntax to read input and write output in many C challenges. As you work through these problems, review the code stubs to learn about reading from stdin and writing to stdout.

## Task

This challenge requires you to print "Hello, World!" on a single line, and then print the already provided input string to stdout. If you are not familiar with C, you may want to read about the printf() command.

## Example

`s = "Life is beautiful"`

The required output is:

```
Hello, World!
Life is beautiful
```

## Function Description

The main() function has the following input:

- `string s`: a string

## Prints

- Two strings:
  1. "Hello, World!" on one line
  2. The input string on the next line.

## Input Format

There is one line of text, `s`.
