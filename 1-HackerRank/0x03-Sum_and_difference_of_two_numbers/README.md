# Integer and Float Operations in C

## Objective

In this challenge, we will explore the fundamental data types in C: `int` and `float`. We'll learn how to perform basic operations and format the output using `printf()` and `scanf()` functions.

### `printf()` and `scanf()`

- The `printf()` function prints statements to the console. The syntax is `printf("format string", argument_list);`. In the format string, use `%d` for integers, `%c` for characters, `%s` for strings, and `%f` for floats.

- The `scanf()` function reads input data from the console. The syntax is `scanf("format string", argument_list);`. For example, `scanf("%d", &number)` reads an integer and stores it in the variable `number`.

- To input two integers separated by a space on a single line, use `scanf("%d %d", &n, &m)`.

## Task

Your task is to take two numbers of `int` data type and two numbers of `float` data type as input, and output their sum:

1. Declare 4 variables: two of type `int` and two of type `float`.
2. Read 2 lines of input from stdin (as specified in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your variables.
3. Use the `+` and `-` operators to perform the following operations:
   - Print the sum and difference of two `int` variables on a new line.
   - Print the sum and difference of two `float` variables rounded to one decimal place on a new line.

## Input Format

The first line contains two integers.
The second line contains two floating point numbers.

## Constraints

- `int` variables.
- `float` variables.

## Output Format

Print the sum and difference of both integers separated by a space on the first line, and the sum and difference of both floats (scaled to 1 decimal place) separated by a space on the second line.

## Sample Input

```
10 4
4.0 2.0
```

## Sample Output

```
14 6
6.0 2.0
```

## Explanation

- When we sum the integers 10 and 4, we get 14. When we subtract the second number 4 from the first number 10, we get 6 as their difference.

- When we sum the floating-point numbers 4.0 and 2.0, we get 6.0. When we subtract the second number 2.0 from the first number 4.0, we get 2.0 as their difference.
