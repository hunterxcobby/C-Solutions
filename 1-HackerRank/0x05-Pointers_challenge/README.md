# Pointers Challenge

## Objective

In this challenge, you will delve into implementing basic functionalities of pointers in C. Pointers in C allow you to share a memory address among different contexts, primarily functions. They are crucial when a function needs to modify the content of a variable it doesn't own.

To access the memory address of a variable `val`, you prepend it with an ampersand `&`. For instance, `&val` returns the memory address of `val`.

This memory address can be assigned to a pointer and shared among various functions. For instance, `int* p = &val;` assigns the memory address of `val` to pointer `p`. To access the content of the memory to which the pointer points, you prepend it with an asterisk `*`. For instance, `*p` returns the value reflected by `val`, and any modification to it will be reflected at the source (`val`).

```c
void increment(int *v) {
    (*v)++; 
}
int main() {
    int a;
    scanf("%d", &a);
    increment(&a);
    printf("%d", a);
    return 0;      
}     
```

## Task

Complete the function `void update(int *a, int *b)`. It receives two integer pointers, `int* a` and `int* b`. Set the value of `a` to their sum, and `b` to their absolute difference. There is no return value, and no return statement is needed.

## Input Format

The input will contain two integers, `a` and `b`, separated by a newline.

## Output Format

Modify the two values in place and the code stub `main()` will print their values.

Note: Input/output will be automatically handled. You only have to complete the function described in the 'task' section.

## Sample Input

```
4
5
```

## Sample Output

```
9
1
```

## Explanation

- `a` gets updated to `4 + 5 = 9`
- `b` gets updated to `|4 - 5| = 1`
